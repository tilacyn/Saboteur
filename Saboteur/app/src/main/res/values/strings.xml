        Here are the sacred rules\n
        Prelude:\n
        1. This game is our own invention, all rights reserved.
        Though it is an open source project still copying, spreading and using our code for money
        is against the law and will be punished immediately.\n
        2. All the events and heroes are entirely fictional, even those based on the real characters.\n
        3. Game content is rather irrelevant for people aged more than 16\n
        Beware! Violence scenes in the game might badly influence young children\n\n
        Best wishes and have a good time!\n
        Maksim Kryuchkov and SDT (Saboteur Developers Team)\n\n\n
        Game rules:\n
        1. Before the game startsâ€¦\n
        Saboteur is a team game, actually there are two teams: Saboteurs and Breadwinners.
        Breadwinners is a team of good and honest gnomes which prefer making fair wealth to robbery and sabotage.
        While Saboteurs is a team of completely dishonest dangerous and deleterious gnomes (like Vlad Golubtsov)
